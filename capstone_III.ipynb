    "The analysis of computer behavior (both the behavior of individual hosts and the behavior of traffic crossing between hosts) is fundamental to performing cyber security analysis. This assessment evaluates a portion of the data from a Los Alamos National Labs (LANL) data set comprising 90 days of host-based data collection and 90 days of network traffic. Due to the extremely large data set, we opted to limit our analysis to a subset of the total data that was collected on Day 90. We attempted to include only data from the hosts and the network that fell within the same time slot (~370 seconds out of the day). This subset of data was chosen as a means of limiting the data to a size that could be uploaded to GitHub as part of the homework submission process.\n",

    "Who and What: an assessment of the behavior on and between hosts on a network, based on research collected at Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In initiating this project, several questions immediately come to mind even before starting the exploratory data analysis (EDA):\n",
    "* Is there a relationship between specific hosts and the number of packets (or bytes) sent?\n",
    "* Is there a trend in when certain Events occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the assessment progressed it was quickly discovered that the data upload limits severely impacted the amount of analysis that could be effectively performed. Because the data provided by LANL covers such a large quantity of network and host traffic and logs (estimated at 145 GB of network data and 45 GB of host data), we greatly reduced the dataset to something manageable: a total of ~150 MB of combined data from a portion of Day 90. **For emphasis:** this equates to **SIX minutes** of data.\n",

In looking at the labeled port numbers, we noted that the numbers shown exceeded the expected upper bound of 65,536. One specific example is Port75515. The data dictionary did not explain the rationale behind this NOR did it explain why a subset of ports were strictly numeric. We presumed that the folks who created the dataset:\n",
