    "The analysis of computer behavior (both the behavior of individual hosts and the behavior of traffic crossing between hosts) is fundamental to performing cyber security analysis. This EDA session evaluates a portion of the data from a Los Alamos National Labs data set comprising 90 days of host-based data collection and 90 days of network traffic. Due to the extremely large data set, we opted to limit our analysis to a subset of the total data that was collected on day 90. We attempted to include only data from the hosts and the network that fell within the same time slot (from xx:xx to xx:xx). This subset of data was chosen as a means of decreasing the overall data processing time needed.\n",
